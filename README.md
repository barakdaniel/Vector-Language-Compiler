Course name: Automats and compilation.
This is the course final project, building a compiler from vector language to a c file.
The compiler built with the usage of Bison and Flex.

## Compiling the code:
first use the make command to create the "vcc" compiler, the vcc compiler expects to get an input file and output file with full paths names.
After running the compiler with the desired input file, the output file you have entered will be a .c file which can be compiled and run.
